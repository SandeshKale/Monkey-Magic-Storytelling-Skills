# AWAAZ Episode 1: clip prompts (6-second clips, about 400x736)

**Output limits (paid Grok account, as reported):** videos still render at 6 seconds and about 400x736. Generations are no longer rationed.

## What changed for 6-second clips
- **Every clip is generated at 6 seconds and trimmed to 5 in the edit.** The extra second absorbs timing drift (the first approved take had its spoken word about 0.3 s late).
- **Clips 11 and 12 are now one 6-second generation.** The final freeze is made in post from its last frame. Episode 1 is **11 clips**, not 12.
- **The stage-talk insert (INS-9) is a still image, not a video.** I put it on the laptop screen with a slow push-in.
- **The phone voice comes from 3 six-second voice sessions** (VS-A, VS-B, VS-C), one or two lines each. The last whispered word "मम्मी..." is cut from the start of VS-A, so no fourth session is needed.
- **Low resolution:** every prompt asks for large faces and hands, simple backgrounds and no tiny details. I upscale to 1080x1920 in the edit (Lanczos with light sharpening and film grain). It will look soft on a big screen and fine on a phone.
- **Clip 10 (the sprint) is reframed** as a medium tracking shot, because a wide shot falls apart at 400 pixels.

## Order of work (14 generations, plus images)
| Step | Generations | What |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | VS-A, VS-B, VS-C | The three voice sessions (audio only is used). |
| 2 | Clip 02, clip 03, clip 04 | Clip 01 is already approved. |
| 3 | Clip 05, clip 06, clip 07 | |
| 4 | Clip 08, clip 09, clip 10 | Clip 09 needs the INS-9 still first. |
| 5 | Clip 11 | Then I assemble the episode. |

Retakes are extra. Do the contact sheets first.

## Method for every clip (2 steps)
1. **Keyframe still.** Grok image mode, attach the references listed for the clip, paste the **KEYFRAME** prompt. Keep the one where the face matches the contact sheet.
2. **Animate.** Grok video mode, start image = the approved still, **6 seconds**, **9:16**, paste the **ANIMATE** prompt.

Send each clip as soon as it is made so I can check lip-sync, voices and faces before you spend another generation.

## Standing rules from Sandesh (apply to every prompt and every review)
1. **Objects are handled as a real person would:** real hand grips, correct anatomy (five fingers, natural joints), screens facing the user, a phone held at the ear on calls, strict physics (weight, contact, motion).
2. **Performances are subtle, restrained and naturalistic, never exaggerated:** feeling shows in the eyes, brow, breath and hands. No wide-open mouths, bulging eyes, flailing or theatrical gestures.

These rules are inside every KEYFRAME and ANIMATE prompt below, and in the review checklist.

## Shared checks for every clip
Lips match the words. Objects are handled correctly (grips, anatomy, screens facing the user, phone at the ear, physics). The performance is restrained. The voices are clearly different. The face matches the contact sheet. No readable text. No cuts or ghost images. Natural motion. The phone is silent (its voice is mixed in post).

## The phone voice is made separately (new)
Grok gave the phone voice to the person on screen, or not at all, so the cloned voice is **not** generated inside the Sushma clips any more. Instead:

1. In each Sushma clip, the phone is silent and she reacts to it. Only her own lines are spoken.
2. Generate the three **voice sessions** below: Kabir crying into a phone in a parked car. We use only the **audio**; the picture is thrown away. Start from the Kabir contact sheet face crop.
3. I cut each line from the sessions, filter it to sound like a cheap phone speaker (narrow band, slight distortion), and place it at the exact time shown on each clip.

This also keeps the cloned voice close to the real Kabir's voice, which is the point of the story.

## CLIP 01: HOOK (0:00 to 0:05)

**References to attach for the keyframe:** CS-SUSHMA, LOC-PUNE

### KEYFRAME (image mode)
```
Close-up of SUSHMA in the kitchen of a small middle-class Indian flat in Pune at night: warm tungsten light, steel kitchen counter and containers, a wooden dining table with a plastic runner. A phone is pressed to her ear in her floury right hand, a little flour dusted on her cheek, her left hand flat on the steel counter beside a steel plate of dough. Reading glasses pushed up on her head. Her expression has only just begun to change from ordinary to alarmed. SUSHMA RAO: Indian woman, 58, 155 cm, medium build, wheatish skin with deep smile lines, greying black hair in a loose low bun with silver streaks, a small round red bindi on her forehead, round tortoiseshell reading glasses (pushed up on her head unless stated), small gold nose stud, small gold earrings, a sage-green cotton saree with a thin printed border over a deep teal blouse, a thin gold bangle on each wrist, no necklace, flour on her hands. Objects held correctly with real hand grips and correct anatomy (five fingers, natural joints); a phone at the ear on calls; screens facing the person using them. Expression subtle and naturalistic, not exaggerated. Photorealistic, vertical 9:16, natural skin with pores and fine detail, real fabric texture, shallow depth of field, teal shadows with warm practical light, handheld documentary realism. No text, no captions, no watermarks, no logos, no readable writing on any screen or sign.
```

### ANIMATE (video mode, 6 s)
```
Animate the supplied start image as ONE continuous shot, 6 seconds long, no cuts. All of the action below happens in the first 5 seconds; after that, hold the final pose almost still. Keep the people, the place, the clothes and the light EXACTLY as in the start image; do not change any face.

PEOPLE: Sushma: Indian woman, 58, greying bun, small red bindi, reading glasses on her head, gold nose stud, sage-green saree over a deep teal blouse, floury hands.

WHAT MOVES: 0.0 to 0.3 s: she is already on the call, the phone at her ear. 0.3 to 2.2 s: someone on the other end is crying and begging (you do not hear them in this clip); within about a second her face tightens, her eyes widen slightly and her breath catches, and her left hand rests firmly on the counter edge; her mouth stays closed or barely parted. 2.4 to 3.4 s: she says one soft word, lips matching. 3.4 to 5.0 s: she stares ahead, very still, her eyes glistening and filling slowly; no gasping, no wide eyes.

CAMERA: Handheld CLOSE-UP, her face fills the frame with shoulders just visible, eye level, slow push-in.

PHYSICS: Flour dust falls from her fingers. Her hand shakes with real fear. The phone rests against her cheek and presses her hair slightly.

STANDING RULES: STANDING RULES. (1) Objects are handled as a real person would: real hand grips, correct anatomy (five fingers, natural joints), a phone held to the ear with its microphone near the mouth on calls, screens facing the person who reads them, a laptop open facing its user, strict physics for weight, contact and motion. (2) Performances are subtle, restrained and naturalistic, never exaggerated: show feeling through small changes in the eyes, brow, breath and hands; no wide-open mouths, no bulging eyes, no flailing, no theatrical gestures.

LIP SYNC: Only the person who is speaking moves their lips, and every word matches their lips exactly. IMPORTANT: the phone is completely silent in this clip. Nobody but the people listed under DIALOGUE speaks. Sushma reacts as if she is hearing a crying, panicked voice on the phone starting at about 0.3 s, and she stops her own speech while it plays.

VOICES (clearly different from each other):
- SUSHMA: a woman in her late 50s, warm, mid-low pitch, breathy and shaky with fear.

DIALOGUE in natural conversational Hindi, in this order, no overlap:
1. at about 2.5 s, SUSHMA: "कबीर?" (pronounced: Kabir?)
Each line must be clearly audible.

AUDIO: Kitchen ambience only: exhaust fan hum, a distant pressure-cooker whistle, a wall clock ticking, her breath. No phone ringing.

STYLE: Photorealistic live-action cinema, vertical 9:16, 24 fps, natural motion blur, real skin texture, strict real-world physics (gravity, momentum, cloth, hair, liquid all behave naturally). Instant hard cuts only, no dissolves. No text, subtitles, logos or readable writing anywhere in the picture. No background music.

DURATION: 6 seconds (the maximum the tool gives). Large faces and hands, simple background, no tiny details.
```

**Dialogue for your check**

- Cloned voice (phone) @ 0.3 s: मम्मी! मम्मी, मुझे बचा लो! / Mummy! Mummy, mujhe bacha lo! / Mummy! Mummy, save me!
- Sushma @ 2.5 s: कबीर? / Kabir? / Kabir?

**Phone voice (added in post, not generated in this clip):** "मम्मी! मम्मी, मुझे बचा लो!" at 0.3 s. I take it from the voice session and filter it to sound like a phone.

**Post note:** Title card AWAAZ · EP 1 and the word PUNE in the first second.

Medium close-up of SUSHMA at the kitchen counter in a small middle-class Indian flat in Pune at night: warm tungsten light, steel kitchen counter and containers, a wooden dining table with a plastic runner, the phone pressed to her ear with her right hand, her left hand flat on the steel counter with white flour handprints around it. Her face is frozen in dawning panic. SUSHMA RAO: Indian woman, 58, 155 cm, medium build, wheatish skin with deep smile lines, greying black hair in a loose low bun with silver streaks, a small round red bindi on her forehead, round tortoiseshell reading glasses (pushed up on her head unless stated), small gold nose stud, small gold earrings, a sage-green cotton saree with a thin printed border over a deep teal blouse, a thin gold bangle on each wrist, no necklace, flour on her hands.

WHAT MOVES: 0.0 to 0.4 s: she stands rigid, listening. 0.4 to 2.8 s: the tinny crying voice from the phone speaks; her face tightens, her lips tremble slightly and her eyes glisten; her left hand presses on the counter edge and leaves white floury fingerprints on the steel; no sobbing, no open-mouthed crying. 3.0 to 4.4 s: she speaks, her voice cracking, lips matching. 4.4 to 5.0 s: she closes her eyes for a moment and breathes in slowly.

CAMERA: Handheld medium close-up, a little lower than eye level, slow push-in.

Medium close-up of SUSHMA seated at the small wooden dining table in a small middle-class Indian flat in Pune at night: warm tungsten light, steel kitchen counter and containers, a wooden dining table with a plastic runner. A phone lies flat on the table in front of her. A steel thali with half-eaten dinner is pushed aside. Her reading glasses are pushed up on her head. Her hands rest on the table beside the phone, lightly floury and trembling. Her face is tense and still, her mouth closed.

PHYSICS: Phone light flickers on her glasses lenses. Her flinch moves her whole head a few centimetres back.

STANDING RULES: STANDING RULES. (1) Objects are handled as a real person would: real hand grips, correct anatomy (five fingers, natural joints), a phone held to the ear with its microphone near the mouth on calls, screens facing the person who reads them, a laptop open facing its user, strict physics for weight, contact and motion. (2) Performances are subtle, restrained and naturalistic, never exaggerated: show feeling through small changes in the eyes, brow, breath and hands; no wide-open mouths, no bulging eyes, no flailing, no theatrical gestures.

LIP SYNC: Only the person who is speaking moves their lips, and every word matches their lips exactly. IMPORTANT: the phone is completely silent in this clip. Nobody but the people listed under DIALOGUE speaks. Sushma reacts as if she is hearing a crying, panicked voice on the phone starting at about 3.2 s, and she stops her own speech while it plays.

VOICES (clearly different from each other):
- SUSHMA: a woman in her late 50s, warm, mid-low pitch, breathy and shaky with fear.

DIALOGUE in natural conversational Hindi, in this order, no overlap:
1. at about 1.4 s, SUSHMA: "ये नाम तो राहुल का है?" (pronounced: Ye naam toh Rahul ka hai?)
Each line must be clearly audible.

AUDIO: Fan hum, a clock tick, her breathing, the phone voice.

STYLE: Photorealistic live-action cinema, vertical 9:16, 24 fps, natural motion blur, real skin texture, strict real-world physics (gravity, momentum, cloth, hair, liquid all behave naturally). Instant hard cuts only, no dissolves. No text, subtitles, logos or readable writing anywhere in the picture. No background music.

DURATION: 6 seconds (the maximum the tool gives). Large faces and hands, simple background, no tiny details.
```

**Dialogue for your check**

- Sushma @ 1.4 s: ये नाम तो राहुल का है? / Ye naam toh Rahul ka hai? / This name is Rahul's?
- Cloned voice (phone) @ 3.2 s: जल्दी करो, मम्मी! / Jaldi karo, Mummy! / Hurry, Mummy!

**Phone voice (added in post, not generated in this clip):** "जल्दी करो, मम्मी!" at 3.2 s. I take it from the voice session and filter it to sound like a phone.

**Post note:** Add the UPI receiver-name overlay (a made-up name) if you want the viewer to read what she reads.

RIYA arrives from the left with a white mug, olive kurta, lanyard. Kabir's phone lies face-down on the desk between them. KABIR RAO: Indian man, 32, slim, medium-brown skin, oval face with a soft jawline, thick black hair short at the sides and slightly tousled on top with a side parting, light stubble, thin round gunmetal wire-frame glasses with perfectly clear untinted lenses, mid-grey bomber jacket over a muted-blue crew-neck T-shirt, dark navy chinos, black smartwatch on his left wrist, ONE yellow-and-black mechanical pencil (only this one pencil exists). RIYA MENON: Indian woman, 24, slim, round friendly face, large dark eyes, shoulder-length straight black hair in a low ponytail, small silver stud earrings, olive-green cotton kurta over blue jeans, company lanyard with a plain white card, no glasses. Objects held correctly with real hand grips and correct anatomy (five fingers, natural joints); a phone at the ear on calls; screens facing the person using them. Expression subtle and naturalistic, not exaggerated. Photorealistic, vertical 9:16, natural skin with pores and fine detail, real fabric texture, shallow depth of field, teal shadows with warm practical light, handheld documentary realism.

CAMERA: Handheld extreme close-up on the phone and thumb for the first 3 s, then a slow rack focus to her face, then back to the thumb. Faces and the thumb fill the frame.

DURATION: 6 seconds (the maximum the tool gives). Large faces and hands, simple background, no tiny details.

**Dialogue for your check**

- Cloned voice (phone) @ 1.0 s: मम्मी, मुझसे प्यार है तो भेजो! / Mummy, mujhse pyaar hai toh bhejo! / Mummy, if you love me, send it!
- Sushma @ 3.1 s: कौन-सा कबीर? / Kaun-sa Kabir? / Which Kabir?

**Phone voice (added in post, not generated in this clip):** "मम्मी, मुझसे प्यार है तो भेजो!" at 1.0 s. I take it from the voice session and filter it to sound like a phone.

**Post note:** Hold the last frame (freeze) from 0:56 to 0:59.5, caption कौन-सा कबीर? and EP 2 →, cut to black at 0:59.5. Mix the faint last word 'मम्मी...' from voice session A over the freeze.

## CLIP INS-9: PROP (still for clip 09)

**References to attach for the keyframe:** PROP-STAGE, CS-KABIR

### KEYFRAME (image mode)
```
Photorealistic 16:9 still of KABIR RAO on a modern tech conference stage at a lectern, mid-sentence, one hand raised palm-up, a headset microphone at his cheek, a large screen behind him with an abstract waveform and no text, a dark blurred audience in the foreground. KABIR RAO: Indian man, 32, slim, medium-brown skin, oval face with a soft jawline, thick black hair short at the sides and slightly tousled on top with a side parting, light stubble, thin round gunmetal wire-frame glasses with perfectly clear untinted lenses, mid-grey bomber jacket over a muted-blue crew-neck T-shirt, dark navy chinos, black smartwatch on his left wrist, ONE yellow-and-black mechanical pencil (only this one pencil exists). Objects held correctly with real hand grips and correct anatomy (five fingers, natural joints); a phone at the ear on calls; screens facing the person using them. Expression subtle and naturalistic, not exaggerated. Photorealistic, 16:9, natural skin with pores and fine detail, real fabric texture, shallow depth of field, teal shadows with warm practical light, handheld documentary realism. No text, no captions, no watermarks, no logos, no readable writing on any screen or sign.
```

### ANIMATE
None. Still only, see the post note.

**Dialogue for your check**

- Kabir @ 0.6 s: बस तीन सेकंड की आवाज़ चाहिए। और क्लोन तैयार। / Bas teen second ki aawaaz chahiye. Aur clone taiyaar. / I only need three seconds of voice. And the clone is ready.

**Post note:** STILL ONLY: do not make a video. Use the approved PROP-STAGE picture; I put it on the laptop screen in clip 09 with a slow push-in. Not counted in the 60 seconds.
